excerpt: "About Me..."

---
Hello! I am an Associate Professor in the School of Computing and Information Science at the University of Maine. I am also working with the Climate Change Institute as a Cooperating Associate Professor. My research interests include high-performance computing, large-scale simulation of the world's ice sheets, high-performance parallel I/O, training of large-scale neural networks, cloud computing, and networking. Before joining the faculty here, I spent seven years in Chicago where I was an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at the Illinois Institute of Technology and a Visting Scientist at Argonne National Laboratory. I also spent three years in a post-doctoral position as a Staff Scienctist at ICASE (Instutute for Computing in Science and Engineering) at the NASA Langley Research Center. My personal interests include playing guitar, hiking (knees permitting), and enjoying this absolutely beautiful summer in Maine (will update in the winter).
